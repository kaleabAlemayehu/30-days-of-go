# 30 Days Of Go
I created this challange to learn the basics of [Go](https://golang.org/) in 30 days. I used my inspiration
from the language design of golang, computer science topics and programming concepts in general to create this collection of challanges.
Learn by trial and error, hack on the exercises and run *go test*.
Feedback on how to clean up the code is appreciated :)

### Hello World
**[01-hello-world](01-hello-world)** - Our very first Go program!

**[02-unit-tests](02-unit-tests)** - Yes we will unit test our examples. Go's shipped with a very good unit testing package
called testing. We will also explore testify since it gives us assertion and mocking abilities.

**[03-functions](03-functions)** - Let's learn the syntax of functions and how to catch multiple return values
