# 30 Days Of Go
I created this challange to learn the basics of [Go](https://golang.org/) in 30 days. I used my inspiration
from the language design of golang, computer science topics and programming concepts in general to create this collection of challanges.
Learn by trial and error, hack on the exercises and run *go test*.
Feedback on how to clean up the code is appreciated :)
