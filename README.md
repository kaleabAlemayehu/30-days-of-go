# 30 Days Of Go
Learn the basics of [Go](https://golang.org/) in 30 days.
I created this collection of exercises from various topics that I find interesting.

## Feedback is appreciated!
If you want to share your knowledge on how to write more idiomatic Go code, feel free to write me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/osterbergmarcus) or create a pull request.

If you are inspired to learn Go, hack on the exercises and run *go run* or *go test*. Learn by trial and error :)

### Hello World
**[01-hello-world](01-hello-world)** - Our very first Go program!

**[02-unit-tests](02-unit-tests)** - Yes we will unit test our examples. Go's shipped with a very good unit testing package
called testing. We will also explore testify since it gives us assertion and mocking abilities.

**[03-functions](03-functions)** - Funcitons in Go are first class citizens and supports many known patterns from functional programming. Let's learn the syntax of functions.

### Go is all about types
**[04-structs](04-structs)** - Here we look into structs and how to create your own types!

**[05-interfaces](05-interfaces)** - Polymorphism is a fancy word, lets figure out what this abstraction is good for.

**[06-slices](06-slices)** - We want to be able to hold multiple values. Here we learn about the power of slices that are
built on top of arrays.

**[07-maps](07-maps)** - Go has maps. Let's check it out!

### Abstract data structures
**[08-lists](08-lists)** - So far we've learned about some of the built in types and data structures in Go. Time to pracctice our new
knowledge by implementing our own data structures. First out is Lists!

**[09-linked-lists](09-linked-lists)** - A linked list is a very well known and used abstraction in common languages. Here we will create
a simple version.

**[10-trees](10-trees)** - Trees are widley used. Lets try to create a basic tree structure.

**[11-binary-search-trees]**
