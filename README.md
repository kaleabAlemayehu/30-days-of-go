# 30 Days Of Go
I created this challange to learn the basics of [Go](https://golang.org/) in 30 days. I used my inspiration from computer science topics and programming concepts in general to create this collection of challanges.
Learn by trial and error, hack on the exercises and run *go run* or *go test*.
Feedback on how to clean up the code is appreciated :)

### Hello World
**[01-hello-world](01-hello-world)** - Our very first Go program!

**[02-unit-tests](02-unit-tests)** - Yes we will unit test our examples. Go's shipped with a very good unit testing package
called testing. We will also explore testify since it gives us assertion and mocking abilities.

**[03-functions](03-functions)** - Let's learn the syntax of functions and how to catch multiple return values.

** - I/O upcoming...
### Go is all about types

**[04-structs](04-structs)** - Here we look into structs and how to create your own types!

**[05-interfaces](05-interfaces)** - Polymorphism is a fancy word, lets figure out what this abstraction is good for.
