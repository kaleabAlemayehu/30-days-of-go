# 30 Days Of Go
Learn the basics of [Go](https://golang.org/) in 30 days.
I created this collection of exercises from various computer science topics and programming concepts to
learn the basics of Go!

## Feedback is appreciated!
If you have an idea on how to write more idiomatic Go code.
Feel free to write me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/osterbergmarcus) or create a pull request.

Learn by trial and error, hack on the exercises and run *go run* or *go test* :)

### Hello World
**[01-hello-world](01-hello-world)** - Our very first Go program!

**[02-unit-tests](02-unit-tests)** - Yes we will unit test our examples. Go's shipped with a very good unit testing package
called testing. We will also explore testify since it gives us assertion and mocking abilities.

**[03-functions](03-functions)** - Let's learn the syntax of functions and how to catch multiple return values.

### Go is all about types
**[04-structs](04-structs)** - Here we look into structs and how to create your own types!

**[05-interfaces](05-interfaces)** - Polymorphism is a fancy word, lets figure out what this abstraction is good for.

**[06-slices](06-slices)** - We want to be able to hold multiple values. Here we learn about the power of slices that are
built on top of arrays.

**[07-maps](07-maps)** - Go has an associative array called map. Let's check it out!

### Everything is data
**[08-lists](08-lists)** - So far we've learned about some of the built in types and data structures in Go. Time to pracctice our new
knowledge by implementing our own data structures. First out is Lists!

**[09-linked-lists](09-linked-lists)** - A linked list is a very well known and used abstraction in common languages. Here we will create
a very simple version.
